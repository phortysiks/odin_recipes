    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>150g diced pancetta or smoked bacon lardons</li>
        <li>4 courgettes, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>handful freshly grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 small tub (200g) low-fat crème fraîche</li>
        <li>300g tagliatelle</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and sizzle the pancetta or bacon for about 5 mins until starting to crisp. Turn up the heat and add the grated courgette to the pan. Cook for 5 mins or until soft and starting to brown then add the garlic and cook for a minute longer. Season and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the tagliatelle according to the pack instructions and scoop out a cupful of cooking water. Drain the tagliatelle and tip into the frying pan with the bacon and courgette. Over a low heat toss everything together with the crème fraiche and half the Parmesan adding a splash of pasta water too if you need to loosen the sauce. Season to taste and serve twirled into bowls with the remaining Parmesan scattered over.</li>
